 * `confluentcloud.TransitGatewayAttachment` describes a Transit Gateway Attachment data source.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as confluentcloud from "@pulumi/confluentcloud";
 *
 * const exampleUsingIdTransitGatewayAttachment = confluentcloud.getTransitGatewayAttachment({
 *     id: "tgwa-abc123",
 *     environment: {
 *         id: "env-xyz456",
 *     },
 * });
 * export const exampleUsingId = exampleUsingIdTransitGatewayAttachment;
 * const exampleUsingNameTransitGatewayAttachment = confluentcloud.getTransitGatewayAttachment({
 *     displayName: "my_tgwa",
 *     environment: {
 *         id: "env-xyz456",
 *     },
 * });
 * export const exampleUsingName = exampleUsingNameTransitGatewayAttachment;
