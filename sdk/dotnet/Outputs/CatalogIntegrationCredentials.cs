        /// 
        /// &gt; **Note:** Use Option #2 to simplify the key rotation process. When using Option #1, to rotate a Tableflow API key, create a new Tableflow API key, update the `Credentials` block in all configuration files to use the new Tableflow API key, run `pulumi up -target="confluent_catalog_integration.example"`, and remove the old Tableflow API key. Alternatively, in case the old Tableflow API Key was deleted already, you might need to run `pulumi preview -refresh=false -target="confluent_catalog_integration.example" -out=rotate-tableflow-api-key` and `pulumi up rotate-tableflow-api-key` instead.
        /// 
        /// !&gt; **Warning:** Use Option #2 to avoid exposing sensitive `Credentials` value in a state file. When using Option #1, Terraform doesn't encrypt the sensitive `Credentials` value of the `confluentcloud.CatalogIntegration` resource, so you must keep your state file secure to avoid exposing it. Refer to the Terraform documentation to learn more about securing your state file.
